   - Can update with empty names
   - No phone format validation
   - No duplicate phone check
   - **Impact:** Data integrity issues

2. **Excel Import Creates Duplicates**
   - No duplicate detection
   - Can import same guest multiple times
   - **Impact:** Database pollution

3. **File Upload Security**
   - No file size limit
   - No file type validation
   - No malware scanning
   - **Impact:** Security vulnerability

### Important Issues 🟡

4. **Phone Number Unique Constraint**
   - Database requires unique phone
   - Families can't share numbers
   - **Impact:** Real-world usage problems

5. **No Soft Delete**
   - Permanent deletion
   - No audit trail
   - Can't recover deleted guests
   - **Impact:** Data loss risk

6. **Agent Cannot Update Guests**

## 🔧 Quick Fixes Needed

### Priority 1 (Do Now)
```python
# 1. Add validation to update endpoint
if not data.get("first_name") or not data.get("last_name"):
    return error("Name is required")

# 2. Add duplicate check to import
existing = check_duplicate(name, phone)
if existing:
    skip_or_update()

# 3. Add file size limit
MAX_SIZE = 5 * 1024 * 1024  # 5MB
if file_size > MAX_SIZE:
    return error("File too large")
```

### Priority 2 (This Week)
```python
# 4. Remove phone unique constraint
phone = Column(String(20), nullable=True, unique=False)

# 5. Add soft delete
deleted_at = Column(DateTime, nullable=True)

# 6. Add batch processing for imports
for batch in chunks(guests, 100):
    bulk_insert(batch)
```
